## Practical information

### Computers

All participants will be handed a laptop with Virtualbox installed. All 
particpants are expected to handle this laptop with care, and to ensure that
nobody gets access to it. 

### Virtualbox
Virtualbox is a program that enables you to have a computer running virtually
inside your computer. You will "install" a specific version of linux inside
virtualbox. This is what we will use to interface with the cluster that we will
use for processing the data.


### Abel
We will use the University of Oslo's High Performance Computing cluster for 
most of our work. For more about how Abel works. see here.

Please note: transfer and storage of data on abel is only allowed with prior
approval by Karin.
