# Specific gene annotation

Goal ist to show:

- specific gene finding
  - two methods
    - assembly, then blast
    - mapping, then local assembly then comparison
  - using asm first may be risky, may transport asm errors into prediction
  - why not just base ourselves on prokka - specific tools give info at greater specificity
  - how ariba actually works
  - importance of databases  
- MLST sequences
  - what is an MLST sequence
  - MLST schemes
  - MLSt prediction from wgs data
  - ariba output
  - phyloviz?
- AMR prediction
  - sort out AMR genes vs mutations
  - ariba output of AMR genes


Practical

- mlst prediction of our test genome
- amr prediction of our test genome
