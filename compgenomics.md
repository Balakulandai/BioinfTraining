# Comparative genomics

Teacher: Karin Lagesen


## Format for this course

The course takes place on Mondays, at 9am, in Resepten. Remember to bring your
laptops. We will be running analyses on abel, and using tools within the 
virtual machine for evaluation of the results.

Each week we will do the following:
  * Introduction to today's theme
  * Practical exercise on a small dataset
  * Homework, where you will perform the same types of exercise on a different 
  given dataset
  
Most weeks, two students will be asked to review some more material regarding
how something works, and then prepare a short (10-15 minutes) presentation on
the subject.


## Practicals

* [Assembly](assembly.md)
* [Genome annotation](annotation.md)
* [Specific gene annotation](specificgene.md)
