# Introduction (PowerPoint slides)
## Read Mapping
 1. Read Coverage on target
 2. Some of the tools used for read mapping approach

## Local alignment (BLAST)
 1. How much % of the target is covered and similarity 

# ARIBA: ReadMapping Approach
Using Fastq (read) files illumina to search against user defined AMR, Virulence and MLST using ARIBA.

### AMR/Virulence
1. Live demo of creating database from amr gene sequences (fasta)

### MLST
1. Live demo of creating database from new MLST schemes 


# ResFinder and PointFinder: ReadMapping Approach


# MLST tool: Local alignment 
Adding new MLST schemes to the existing schemes
