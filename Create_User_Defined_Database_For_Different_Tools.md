# Introduction (PowerPoint slides)
## Read Mapping
 1. Read Coverage on target
 2. How much % of the target is covered and similarity 
 3. Some of the tools used for read mapping approach

## Local alignment (BLAST)

# ARIBA: ReadMapping Approach
Using Fastq (read) files illumina to search against user defined AMR, Virulence and MLST using ARIBA.

### AMR

### Virulence 

### MLST
# ResFinder and PointFinder: ReadMapping Approach


# MLST tool: Local alignment 
Adding new MLST schemes to the existing schemes
